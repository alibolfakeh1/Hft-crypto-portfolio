# Roadmap

Maintained by `project-manager`. A phase starts only when the gate it depends on has a verdict. There are no
dates yet, because the server and the reference venue are still open decisions.

| Phase | Deliverable | Lead | Reviewers | Gate | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0 Foundation | Charter, team, strategy and feature documents, leak audit of documents, output, data and app specifications | `project-manager` | `leak-auditor` | G0 | In progress |
| P1 Data center | Zones and catalog on GitHub, historical ingest with catch-up, bars from trades, retention job, hourly live poll, health report, first end-to-end report. See `docs/08_DATA_CENTER.md` | `data-steward`, `developer` | `python-reviewer`, `leak-auditor` | G1 | In progress |
| P2 Engine | Event-driven simulator, timing contract enforced in code, costs, funding, dynamic stops, trial registry, leak test suite | `developer` | `python-reviewer`, `leak-auditor` | G6 (engine) | Not started |
| P3 Baselines | All strategies in `V0S` and `V0`, on `T0` and `T1` data | `developer` | `strategy-architect`, `leak-auditor` | G3 | Not started |
| P4 Portfolio report | Full tear sheets and portfolio report from real baseline results | `developer`, `ui-designer` | `python-reviewer` | G6 | Not started |
| P5 Flow features | Features from the triage, `T1` first and then `T2` | `feature-integrator`, `developer` | `leak-auditor`, `python-reviewer` | G2 | Not started |
| P6 Gates | `VE`, `VX` and `VEX` with walk-forward evaluation | `feature-integrator`, `developer` | `leak-auditor` | G4, G7 | Not started |
| P7 Apps | Desktop app and Telegram bot, on a private test channel | `app-builder`, `ui-designer` | `python-reviewer` | None | Not started |
| P8 Live paper | Paper engine on the hourly cycle, append-only ledger, live positions, **public channel after owner approval** | `developer`, `app-builder` | `leak-auditor`, `python-reviewer` | G8 | Not started |

## Sequencing notes

- **Everything runs on GitHub** (decision `D-15`). There is no order-level recording, so `T3` features wait.
- **Baselines before flow.** If `V0` cannot survive costs, flow must improve it a lot, and that is worth
  knowing before building gates.
- **Apps can begin with P4 results.** They show real `SIMULATED` output, and screens built earlier use
  labelled synthetic data.
- **Live paper need not wait for every strategy.** A strategy can go live on paper once it has passed G6. Its
  posts show its current gate, so an unvalidated strategy is visibly unvalidated.

## Current status

Updated 2026-11-04. Real data has been downloaded and checked for one day. The data center is being built. No
strategy has been coded or tested, so there are no strategy results of any kind.
